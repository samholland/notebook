00:00:00,405 --> 00:00:04,820
(SINGING) I'd like to buy
the world a home and

00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,517
furnish it with love.

00:00:07,517 --> 00:00:11,650
Grow apple trees and
honey bees and

00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,830
snow-white turtle doves.

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,519
I'd like to teach the world to
sing-- sing with me-- in

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,742
perfect harmony.

00:00:20,742 --> 00:00:22,209
Perfect harmony.

00:00:22,209 --> 00:00:27,830
I'd like to buy the world a
Coke and keep it company.

10
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,264
That's the real thing.

sing in perfect harmony.

00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:42,070
I'd like to buy the world a
Coke and keep it company.

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,770
It's the real thing.

14
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,970
Coke is what the world
wants today.

15
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,270
Coca-Cola is the real thing.
