1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,359
in 1943 we see the tide really turns in
favor of the Allies

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:09,960
especially in Europe but it's actually
happening in the pacific as well

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,809
to begin with in 1943 the siege of
Stalingrad was doesn't quite exactly fit

4
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:17,550
on this map it would be would be

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,800
right lira right over here it ends

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,710
with the soviets being two tours in this
is actually an incredible story there's

7
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,369
many movies about the siege it sounds
stalingrad

8
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:31,779
for a reason thus the the soviets are
able to mount a ver

9
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:35,710
pretty epic counterattack by attacking
the flanks

10
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,480
the axes are mean they're able to push
the back in defeat the axes army

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,079
stalingrad itself gets reduced to rubble
and you know if you actually look at

12
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,290
pictures up its

13
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,899
its its its kind of mind-blowing to
deceive imagine what went on there

14
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:51,110
stalingrad right over here although

15
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,660
right now leningrad in 1943 still under
siege in if you want your stomach to

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,579
really be sick

17
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:58,949
look up images of of things that
happened over there

18
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:02,000
but needless to say 1943 its a turning

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,159
or it's not the turning point for you to
really is a turning point but 1943

20
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,860
the moment and really in the allies
favor the soviets be defeat

21
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,180
the germans stalingrad were able to push
the Germans and the Axis powers

22
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,080
out the caucuses and then they can they
begin to advance

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,140
and then the soviets begin to advance
and retake

24
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,220
ground from the Axis powers now at the
same time

25
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,659
you might remember that at the end the
1942

26
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,750
in in North Africa in North Africa

27
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,020
let me go rate over you have all these
maps layered over here

28
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,710
you might remember that the British were
able to

29
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:47,259
push back the axis army back into Libyan
in this case continues as we go into

30
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:47,979
nineteen

31
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:51,360
as we go into nineteen forty-three and

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,500
the Allied armies essentially able to
kick the axis army

33
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,100
out love North African be victorious in
North African you remember

34
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,950
yeah these the armies that are coming
from Egypt you also had

35
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,100
you also had allies land in Morocco

36
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,569
in algeria and they all meet up

37
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:14,520
and by mid-year they're able to use
their victory in North Africa

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,819
as a launching point to start attacking
the mainland amid Lee the first

39
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:22,879
they can go to sicily but then they go
to the actual

40
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,910
mainlanders attack at Salerno and a
starter

41
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,090
to really kind of bite their way up the
Italian peninsula

42
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,250
go do this in a blue-collar so you can
see this is

43
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,450
the allies as we go into bid

44
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:42,310
and late 1943 are able to take more and
more

45
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,319
love the Italian the Italian peninsula

46
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:49,290
now as this happen as this happens
conditions in Italy aren't good

47
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,050
the Italian people aren't happy and
they're actually able to depose

48
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:53,870
mussolini

49
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,200
let me write that down so this is in
1943

50
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,250
mousseline E mousseline the

51
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,700
do you think there's another s mussolini
is deposed

52
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,680
moose so the is

53
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,030
mousseline E is deposed as we get later
that year

54
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,150
Italy warmly surrenders to the allies
there with that said italy has

55
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:18,849
surrendered

56
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:22,790
but the entire country heavily the
entire type it in so they're still

57
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:28,310
axis troops there so the allies have to
continue to slog to 1943 1944

58
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,250
and even into nineteen forty-five to
completely rid

59
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,530
Italy love the Axis powers especially
the germans

60
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,230
now role especially is fairly hard
bombing campaign starring role

61
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,650
in order to completely get the Axis
powers I love that and that all is

62
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,409
happening

63
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:46,940
in 19 this is all happening in nineteen

64
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,670
forty-three now other other things have
noted there's many things that are

65
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,269
happening

66
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:55,280
in Europe and once again these are just
overview videos

67
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,010
that are happening in 1943 is american
forces

68
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,189
he is early is not early 1943 are able
to start doing

69
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:07,080
bombing attacks on Germany itself these
bombing attacks

70
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,760
only become more and more fears as the
war progresses

71
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,380
another battle at No %uh

72
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,400
note in made 1943 is the battle love
cursed

73
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,880
Kirk's and this is really the last
offensive

74
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,480
that the Axis powers are able to mount
on the Eastern Front

75
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,530
and their defeated in this battle by the
soviets

76
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,260
and then once again that allows the
soviets to start going on

77
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,280
the offensive so when you look at things
from a European point of view

78
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,590
the allies are definitely they have the
ball cover the momentum now there now

79
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,950
what kind of putting the squeeze on the
Axis powers

80
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,360
and frankly the same thing is happening
in the Pacific

81
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,150
the especially the americans there now
on the offensive able to get closer and

82
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,430
closer and closer

83
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,540
to Japan
